# Variable Types
It is the case in many programming languages that __variables__ can be assigned, a variable is a container used to store some data.
It is possible to assign a variable as shown below,
```
banana = 1
```
Not all variables are the same, and therefore variables may have different __types__, where different operations are possible depending on the type.
